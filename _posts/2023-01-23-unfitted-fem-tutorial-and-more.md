I have recently added a step-by-step and commented [unfitted Poisson FEM tutorial](https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/dev/pages/t019_unfitted_poisson/#Tutorial-19:-Unfitted-Poisson-1) to Gridap. 

This tutorial is intended to guide Gridap users willing to use the unfitted FEM machinery available at [GridapEmbedded](https://github.com/gridap/GridapEmbedded.jl). Check it out!

Then, I thought I would take the occasion to briefly highlight some **recent review presentations and preprints on unfitted FEM**:

* *If you are not entirely familiar with FEM:*

You can check

> The [slides]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link slides/unfitted-fem/unfitted-fem.html %}) of my talk _Unfitted Finite Element Methods: Decoupling the mesh from the geometry_ at the [Warwick Applied Maths Seminar](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/applmath/) last 25 Nov 2022.

Thanks again to the organisers for their kind invitation!

* *If you know a good deal about FEM:*

I recommend you

> The [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3w2agqX6KM) of the [Severo Ochoa Seminar](https://www.cimne.com/vnews/m2912/11806/video-available-severo-ochoa-seminar---recent-advances-in-unfitted-finite-element-methods-by-santiago-badia) _Recent advances in unfitted finite element methods_ by Santiago Badia at CIMNE on 17/01/2023. 

[Santiago Badia](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/santiago-badia-rodriguez) is full professor at CIMNE and Monash University _and_ Gridap co-creator!

* *But if what you really want to get into the details:*

Other than some references in my slides and Santi's video, I strongly recommend you the recent preprint 

> _[Stability and conditioning of immersed finite element methods: analysis and remedies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08538.pdf)_ by F. de Prenter, C. Verhoosel, H. van Brummelen, M. Larson and S. Badia.

Hope this helps you discover unfitted finite element methods!

Cheers!

Today I gave the second session of a three-part short course in finite element analysis with [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) at [TurlierLab](https://www.turlierlab.com/).

The session was devoted to introduce the Finite Element Method (FEM), which is my main area of expertise. TurlierLab is an interdisciplinary research team composed of physicists, biologists, applied mathematicians, mechanical and computer research engineers. Not all of them are familiar with FEM. By bringing FEM closer to them, I hope we discover new ways to interact with each other.

If you want to learn more about FEM, you can take a look at the [session slides]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link slides/intro-to-fem/intro-to-fem.html %}).

Cheers!

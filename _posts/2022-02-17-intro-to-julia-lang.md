I am currently delivering a (three-part) short course in finite element analysis with [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) at [TurlierLab](https://www.turlierlab.com/).

Gridap provides a set of tools for the grid-based approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs). It is 100% written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

The first session of the course was an introduction to the Julia programming language. The salient feature of Julia is that it **does not force you to trade-off between code performance and code productivity**. Thus, it is a worthy language for computationally-demanding scientific computing applications, such as finite element analysis.

If you want to learn more about Julia, you can take a look at the [session slides]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link slides/intro-to-julia-lang/intro-to-julia-lang.html %}). They contain a curated list of info and resources to help you migrate to Julia from C/C++, Python or any other language.

Cheers!

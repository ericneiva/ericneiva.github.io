I am currently delivering a (three-part) short course in finite element analysis with [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) at [TurlierLab](https://www.turlierlab.com/).

Gridap provides a set of tools for the grid-based approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs). It is 100% written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/).

The first session of the course was devoted to an introduction to the Julia programming language. Julia is the only [Just-In-Time (JIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) compiled language in the [petaflop club](https://juliacomputing.com/media/2017/09/julia-joins-petaflop-club/). As a result, it yields an improved balance between code performance and productivity; which is very desirable in computationally-demanding scientific computing applications, such as finite element analysis.

If you want to learn more about Julia, you can take a look at the session slides [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link slides/intro-to-julia-lang/intro-to-julia-lang.html %}). You'll find there a curated list of info and resources to get started with Julia. Hoping they help anyone interested in migrating to Julia from C/C++, Python or any other language!

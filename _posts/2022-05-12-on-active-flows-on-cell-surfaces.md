Today I gave the last session of a three-part short course in finite element analysis with [Gridap](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) at [TurlierLab](https://www.turlierlab.com/).

The session consisted in **a numerical perspective on modelling and simulating (active) flows on cell surfaces**. I focused on physical models for the plasma membrane and the actomyosin cortex and the main challenges in their numerical approximation.

I will upload the session slides shortly. In the meantime, if you want to take your first dive into the physics and the numerics of this exciting topic, I invite you to check these two references:

*On the actomyosin cortex:*

[Borja da Rocha, H., Bleyer, J., Turlier, H. (2022). A viscous active shell theory of the cell cortex. Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 104876.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2022.104876)

*On lipid membranes and general biological interfaces:*

[Torres-Sánchez, A., Millán, D., Arroyo, M. (2019). Modelling fluid deformable surfaces with an emphasis on biological interfaces. Journal of fluid mechanics, 872, 218-271.](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2019.341)

Last but not least, a shout-out to my lab colleagues for the insightful feedback I received during the session. Thanks, guys!

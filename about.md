I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at [Hervé Turlier's research group](https://www.turlierlab.com/) of the [Centre Interdisciplinaire de Recherche en Biologie (CIRB)](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/en-cirb/index.htm).

*How do single cells form embryos?*

I help biologists and physicists shedding light on this question. To this end, I design novel and cutting-edge **finite element methods** targeting active flows on deformable surfaces.

I have a PhD from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona. My [PhD thesis](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/330735) was on large-scale tree-based unfitted finite elements for metal additive manufacturing.

I hold a double degree in mathematics and civil engineering from the Centre de Formació Interdisciplinària Superior (CFIS) of the UPC.

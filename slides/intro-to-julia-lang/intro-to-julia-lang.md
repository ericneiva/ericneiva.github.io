# Contents

- Motivation
- Course overview
- The Julia programming language
- Getting started with Julia

<!--
  - Give a lot of information
  - But also interactive for a lighter experience
  - Not looking into details
  - Providing a curated selection of info and links to help you migrate to Julia if the situation arises
-->

# Motivation

- An *abstract* FE framework for cell morphogenesis
  - To accommodate all the FE simulation needs in the lab
  - Easily import or prototype new FE technology
  - In Julia, as a subpackage of Gridap

*Borja da Rocha, Bleyer et Turlier, submitted*

<!--
  - The key point is the last one:
    - Abstract = Targeting general fluid deformable surface and coupled surface-bulk problems
    - An easily extensible framework to import and develop new technology
  - Motivate with Hudson's example
    - Admiration for the example
    - Fenics forced to compromises to implement the model with thin shell FEs
      - Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Component (MITC) discretisation
      - Partial Selective Reduced Integration (PSRI) method
    - Difficult to extend the functionality of the code for reasons that we will shortly make clear

# Why Julia?

<!--
  - What sets Julia apart from other languages?
-->

---

# Why Julia?

To answer this, we need to review
*high-level compiled and interpreted programming languages*

<!--
  - Not explaining this as an expert
-->

---

# <!-- fit --> High-level programming languages (almost all)

![width:25cm](imgs/high-level.png)

<!--
  - You need a translation step that converts your high-level code into lower-level machine-readable code
-->

---

# <!-- fit --> Compiled languages (C, C++, Java, ...) ðŸ‘ˆ Performance

<!--
  - In a compiled language, compilation translates your source code into machine instructions.
  - Generates optimized machine code.
-->

---

# <!-- fit --> Interpreted languages (Python, JavaScript, ...) ðŸ‘ˆ Productivity

![width:30cm](imgs/interpreted.png)
*[medium.com, Young Coder, The Difference Between Compiled and Interpreted Languages, Sep 14, 2020](https://medium.com/young-coder/the-difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-languages-d54f66aa71f0)*

<!--
  - The interpreter looks at your code (line by line, in the simplest case) and makes it happen. Interpreters work on smaller sections as you run your program.
-->

---

# <!-- fit --> Trade-off performance and productivity

For computationally-demanding applications (e.g., FEs):
- Hybrid software applications, e.g., fenics: 
  - ``python`` front-end + ``c++`` back-end
  - *two-language problem* > limited extensibility and prototyping
- Julia *potentially* provides better balance
  - performance and productivity _in a single environment_
<!--
  - Do you know the principal culprit for computationally-intensive FEs?
  - User front-end and computational back-end
  - Two-language problem is not a widespread term
  - Limited extensibility example (C1-continuous Loop subdivision FEs in fenics). 
  - Prototyping new FE technologies is even harder 
  - Julia is 
    - as expressive and easy to work with as python, 
    - but can achieve performance comparable to C
-->

# Main features of Julia

- Optional typing
- Multiple dispatch (generalisation of polymorphism)
```julia
    foo(bar) = ...
    foo(bar::Integer) = ...
    foo(bar::Float64) = ...
    foo(bar::MyType1,baz::MyType2) = ...
```
- Multi-paradigm
  - Procedural, functional, meta, object-oriented...

<!--
  - "Integer" is pronounced "Intejar"
  - Return later to multiple dispatch
  - Some OO features (polymorphism, some elementary form of inheritance), but Julia is definitely not OO like C++.
  - Not expert opinion, looks like a hotchpotch
-->

---

# Main features of Julia

- Performance through
  - type inference (deduce output types from input types)
    - generate fast, optimized code
  - just-in-time (JIT) or *run-time* compilation
    - user experience as an intepreted one
- The only non-compiled language in the petaflop $\footnotesize{\left(\mathsf{10^{15}}\right)}$ club
  - Since 2017; along with C, C++ and Fortran

<!--
- Type inference: Refers to the process of deducing the types of later values from the types of input values.
- Just-In-Time Compilation: The process of generating native-machine code into memory right when it is needed.

# Main features of Julia

- Time to first plot or compiler latency
  - JIT compilation time on *first* run
```julia
julia> @time using Plots
  4.860129 seconds (6.87 M allocations: 502.634 MiB, 7.64% gc time, 0.14% compilation time)

julia> @time using Plots
  0.000099 seconds (81 allocations: 5.969 KiB)
```
- Two minor releases per year (+3-5 patch releases per minor)
  - Beware of breaking changes and compiler latency regressions

<!--
- When you profile a first code you realise that all time spent on type inference, i.e. on the generation of optimized code
- Second run is orders of magnitude faster
- Latency and performance generally improves through releases, but progression is unstable and there can be regressions depending on the application
- Talk about your Gridap performance, from older to newer version it can become significant slower TTFP ("soft" breaking changes)
- Increases maintenance burden

# Julia vs Python

- Python has never been so popular (in Feb 2022)
  - #1 in TIOBE index (search engine results)
  - #1 in IEEE Spectrum index
  - #1 in PYPL index
  - ...
- Julia way behind (#20-30). Growing, but not emerging
- Often performance not needed or enough with GPU parallelism

<!--
- Other similarly recent languages are growing at faster rates

<!--
  - Julia is providing performance
  - It is easier to maintain
  - I claim it is more extensible
  - A little bit weird that a code called "pytorch" has more lines in C++ than python
-->

# My case for Julia

* It risks becoming a niche language for scientific computing
* But it could become THE standard in this domain
  - The only *petascale-capable* non-compiled language
  - Improved balance of productivity and performance
    - e.g. in basic research on finite elements
* Further reading: independent benchmarks
  - [Julia vs C gcc](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/julia-gcc.html) -- similar performance, C is best --
  - [Julia vs Python 3](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/julia-python3.html) -- Julia much faster --

# The Julia package manager, Pkg.jl

- Integrated into the REPL ([Pkg documentation](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/))
- Manages _reproducible_ environments, not only packages ðŸ‘ˆ
  - An environment is a record of 
    - Package dependencies and compatibilities in `Project.toml` 
    - Package state (`pkg` version, `git` revision, ...) in `Manifest.toml`
- If a Julia project ($\approx$ library) contains a manifest, this will install the packages in the same state that is given by that manifest

<!--
  - Show HelloWorld example
-->

---

# Set up the working environment

- Work in projects or packages
- Creating packages
  - [With Pkg.jl](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/)
  - [With PkgTemplates.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/wiki/How-to-create-a-new-Julia-package) ðŸ‘ˆ For software projects
    - e.g., set up Github Actions (continuous integration)
  - [With DrWatson.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/dev/) ðŸ‘ˆ For scientific projects
    - e.g., manage and reproduce parametric simulations

<!--
  - A package is a project with a name, uuid and version entry in the Project.toml file, and a src/PackageName.jl file that defines the module PackageName. This file is executed when the package is loaded.
-->

# How to _develop_ your code in Julia?

- Follow [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
- _Option 1:_ Combine your editor of choice and the REPL
  - [REPL-based workflows](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/workflow-tips/) ðŸ‘ˆ Use [Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl)
  - ðŸ’¡ Add `Revise.jl` in the global (default) environment
- _Option 2:_ Use VS Code with Julia extension (THE Julia IDE)
  - [VS Code workflows](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/wiki/Visual-Studio-Code-as-Julia-IDE#6-choose-a-development-workflow)
  - Matlab-ish experience (e.g., workspace browser, debugger...)

<!--
  - Comment on test-driven development
  - Prepare a Revise.jl flow
-->

---

# How to _write_ your code in Julia? 

- [Style guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/)
  - Append `!` to names of functions that modify their arguments
    - e.g., `sort` does not mutate, `sort!` mutates
  - Prefer exported methods over direct field access
    - data members of a type are not hidden
  - Apply naming and argument ordering similar to Julia base
  - ...

<!--
  - Example tst2.jl
  - If you export the type, then you can access the data members
-->

---

# How to _write_ your code in Julia? 

- [Performance tips](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/)
  - Performance critical code should be inside a function ðŸ‘ˆ
    - Julia's compiler works better on code inside functions
    - Avoid global variables
  - Write "type-stable" functions (results in faster code)
  - Measure performance and memory footprint with `@time`
* Use [BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl) and [ProfileView.jl](https://github.com/timholy/ProfileView.jl) ðŸ‘ˆ

<!--
  - Use measure performance with @time to show avoid global variables and time :) (tst3.jl)
  - Use @code_warntype on the example for type-stability (tst4.jl)
  - Mention benchmarks.jl and redirect to time measurement
-->

---

# More on VS Code as Julia IDE

- Quite powerful
  - [Built-in debugger](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl/wiki/Visual-Studio-Code-as-Julia-IDE#5-learn-how-to-run-the-debugger)
  - Native support for Jupyter notebooks (e.g., JuliaTutorials)
  - Embedded results (e.g., plots, profiler, databases)
  - New features every year (announced in JuliaCon)
- [Collaborative sessions](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share)
